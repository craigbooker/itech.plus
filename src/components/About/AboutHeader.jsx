						I'm a Writer and Software Developer from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. My
						love for electronics started while tinkering with electronics when I
						was young. This love for electronic turned into a love for computers
						which in turn lead me to software. My earliest memeories of writing
						was between 2000 and 2001. I wrote off and on for fifteen years
						before I would discover it was a gift. It was always just something
						I did in my spare time to express myself. I never considered it as
						my passion or as a potential career.

						It was while working at Apple where I would learn about Appleâ€™s
						methods in training individuals to get the most out of their
						technology. I also learned about their people-first culture and a
						true appreciation of people of all types. It was while working at
						Apple that I affirmed some of my ideas on customer service. I aim to
						take what I learned at Apple, combining the best customer service, a
						love for great apps and dedication to customers to provide the best
						products and services.
